# Kishore Kumar – Full Stack Developer

I’m **Kishore Kumar**, a **Full Stack Developer with over 4 years of professional experience** in building **scalable, high-performance web applications**. I come from a strong **product engineering background**, with hands-on experience across frontend development, backend systems, cloud architecture, and AI-assisted features.

My primary expertise is in **React, Next.js, Node.js, and AWS**, where I focus on designing clean user interfaces, building reliable backend APIs, and developing cloud-ready systems that scale with real-world usage. I have consistently worked on end-to-end product development, ensuring code quality, performance, and long-term maintainability.

I have a strong background in solving **real-world scalability challenges** and building **AI-assisted web features**. My experience includes working on systems that handle **media processing pipelines**, **real-time analytics dashboards**, and **API-first backend architectures**. Across these systems, I emphasize **security, performance optimization, and scalable design principles** to support growing product demands.

Alongside full stack development, I actively explore **AI integration in modern web applications**, leveraging **Python-based systems** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approaches to enhance product capabilities. This combination of product engineering and AI-driven development shapes my approach to building intelligent, future-ready web platforms.

I enjoy collaborating within **product-focused teams**, working closely with designers, product managers, and engineers to transform complex requirements into scalable, user-centric solutions.
